## About Tumor Expert.
Tumor Expert is a tumor segmentation and classification software built to simplify medical imaging tasks for radiologists.

Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of brain tumors is critical for progression evaluation, treatment planning, and assessment of this disease.

Tumor Expert takes four sequences of MRI Nifti files, namely T1-Weight, T1CE-Weight, T2-weight, and Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images, to segment tumors as Whole Tumor, Enhancing Tumor, non-Enhancing tumor.
